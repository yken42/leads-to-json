Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl starting in 2009. Its development and maintenance is sponsored by Joyent.
Dahl was inspired to create Node.js after seeing a file upload progress bar on Flickr.
The browser did not know how much of the file had been uploaded and had to query the web server.
Dahl wanted an easier way.[5] Ruby's Mongrel web server was another source of inspiration for Dahl.
Originally Dahl had several failed projects in C, Lua, and Haskell, but when Google's V8 engine was released, Dahl began to examine JavaScript.
Even though his original idea was non-blocking he "backed out of that (a bit) in the module system and a few other areas" as it made loading external libraries troublesome.
